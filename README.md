I made a web page in the style of 4 cut that was once popular in korea.

I used html, css, and javascript, and it was interesting to try the mouse over and transition effects for the first time. Also, there was a great difficulty when I tried to insert a video into the web page in the past, but through this lecture, I learned the function called iflim and I could easily insert a video.📹
